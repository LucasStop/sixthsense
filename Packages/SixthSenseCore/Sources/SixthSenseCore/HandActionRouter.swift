// MARK: - Hand Action Router

/// Pure state machine that maps hand readings to high-level actions.
///
/// Current rules:
///
///   • Right hand → always moves the cursor to the smoothed index-tip
///     position, regardless of what gesture is classified. The smoothing
///     is done by a `CursorSmoother` (One Euro Filter) so the cursor
///     feels steady when the hand is still and responsive when it moves
///     fast.
///
///   • Left hand pinch  → clicks at the last known cursor position the
///     moment it transitions into a `.pinch`. Sustained pinch does not
///     spam clicks. A temporal debounce (`clickDebounce`) protects
///     against double-fires when the classifier oscillates between
///     `.pinch` and `.none`. Suppressed while a drag is active.
///
///   • Left hand fist   → starts a drag: emits `.dragBegin` on the
///     transition into `.fist` and `.dragEnd` when the fist is released.
///     The module reads `isDragging` to know whether to dispatch
///     `moveCursor` as `mouseMoved` or `leftMouseDragged`.
///
/// Any other gesture is ignored. When either hand disappears, its
/// tracking state resets so the next entry is a clean edge-trigger, and
/// any active drag is ended safely.
