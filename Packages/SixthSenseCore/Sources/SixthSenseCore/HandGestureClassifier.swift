/// side effects — so it is trivially unit-testable.

/// The classifier is **scale-invariant**: instead of comparing absolute
/// distances to hardcoded thresholds, it normalizes every fingertip distance
/// by the longest one in the snapshot. That way the same gesture is
/// recognized whether the hand is close to the camera (large in frame) or
/// far away (small in frame).
